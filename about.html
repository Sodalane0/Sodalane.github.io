    <p>This is Sodalane.xyz! My personal website that I first started work on while sick on the 24th of February, 2026.</p>
    <p>I was inspired to create this site after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUgOT22F5s&t=1s">this video</a> by Onionboots about the reneissance of the indie web</p>
    <p>I wasn't too sure where to start, but I had some very basic knowledge of HTML and css from 2019 while doing a computer science course in high school</p>
    <p>On top of that experience, I attended a lecture in university where my professor demonstrated how easy it was to host a website via git hub, and all these years later (and with some help from claude) I published my own website!</p>
